# Augment Guidelines for ts-lib-ui-kit

## Pre-commit Checks

Before committing changes, always run the following checks:

```bash
yarn lint        # Run ESLint
yarn typecheck   # Run TypeScript type checking
yarn test:all    # Run all tests (unit + storybook)
```

## Testing

- Use `yarn test:all` to run both unit tests and Storybook component tests
- Use `yarn test` for unit tests only (faster, but doesn't include Storybook tests)
- Test files are located in `__tests__` directories alongside the code they test
- Storybook tests are in `*.stories.tsx` files

## Code Style

- ESLint configuration is in `eslint.config.js` (flat config format)
- Prettier configuration is in `.prettierrc`
- Do not use `eslint-disable-next-line` comments - refactor code instead
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for computed values in React components

## Project Structure

- `src/components/atoms/` - Basic UI components
- `src/components/molecules/` - Composite components
- `src/components/organisms/` - Complex components (graphs, layouts)
- `src/server/` - Server-side utilities
- `scripts/zephyr/` - Zephyr Scale integration scripts

## Zephyr Integration

- Test results are reported to Zephyr Scale via `scripts/zephyr/report-zephyr-results.ts`
- Test case IDs are embedded in test names using format `[SW-T123]`
- Multiple IDs can be specified: `[SW-T100,SW-T101]`
